Many of them were born and raised here, but they are not recognized as Kenyan nationals and have no official status in Zimbabwe, where they arrived from in the 1960s.\nThe Shona community in Kenya is part of a group of around 100 missionaries, who came to establish the Gospel of God Church. When they arrived they were met and welcomed by the first post-independence president of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta.\nDespite the meeting, and receiving the blessing of the president to establish a church, the Shona could not be registered. Under the first post-independence constitution, there was no provision for people not of Kenyan descent to be registered as citizens.\nZephaniah Muungani, a member of the community and a carpenter by profession, said as a community they have gone through many challenges, and they live in fear of being arrested because of the many arrests they faced in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\"Our children have grown facing stiff difficulties in accessing education. This has really slowed development of all Shonas in Kenya. As a result, we have been forced to train our children in weaving, crocheting, carpentry and masonry. Something which our children nearly detest us for, for not encouraging them to take the path of formal education,\" Muungani said.\nHe added even though they are a hard-working community and sometimes make reasonable amounts of money they can keep for the future, they cannot save money because they cannot open bank accounts.\n\"We do not have access to many public facilities such as hospitals, universities and banks. Nowadays even having a simple thing like a mobile phone needs an identity card, which we do not have. We have to get someone with an identity card to register our mobile lines for us,\" Muungani said. \"Businesswise we have to get someone with an identity card to register our businesses. This is very tricky because you have to identify someone whom you can truly trust to do so. However as the saying goes, ‘Every cloud has a silver lining.’ We have managed to survive the tough life through the help of some good Samaritans who have always been ready to help us.\"\nAccording to a report titled \"Understanding the Socioeconomic Profile Of the Shona Community in Kenya\" released in July, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the incidence of poverty is higher among the Shona population in Kenya. The report found on average, more than half the Shona population lives below the national poverty line.\n\"Kenyans in urban areas are twice as likely to attend secondary school as their Shona counterparts. For Shona children of secondary school age, the net secondary school attendance rate is 28 percent, compared to 50 percent among urban Kenyans,\" the report reads.\nAccording to Muungani, the Shona community’s journey to attain legal status has been arduous. He says initially all they could do was to persuade immigration officials to accommodate them, but often they would grant them work and residence permits which would expire after a short period.\n\"The Kenya Human Rights Commission has been instrumental in building our capacity and has stood with us in our quest for identity. They have been working closely with the UNHCR. The recognition of our community from the Kiambu County government affirmed and emboldened us. We met the county governor and several members of parliament under the Kenya Citizenship Caucus, who in turn took our plight to the cabinet secretary responsible for citizenship matters,\" Muungani said.\n\"In both 2019 and 2020 we assembled a sizeable number of Shona members to plead for citizenship. We prepared a community register which we filed with the taskforce on statelessness. This served as evidence we are no longer hiding and are ready to be counted. KHRC offered us legal representation, while the department of immigration provided the needed affirmation we are not illegally in Kenya.\"\nIn August last year, the Kenyan government announced it will start issuing birth certificates to the Shona community, a development that was welcomed across the board.\n\"The issuance of birth certificates to our children raised the hopes of all the members of the Shona community. We felt at last the government had heard our plea and was now responding positively. The government of Kenya needs to register the Shona community as citizens of this country and issue them certificates of citizenship and national identity cards,\" Muungani said."},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd34da4a31024ad0ba9b5ea.html","title":"Xi to address Climate Ambition Summit","time":"2020-12-11 18:44","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd3557aa31024adbda7a71c.jpeg","content":"BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping will deliver a speech at the Climate Ambition Summit on Saturday via video link, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Friday.\nXi will attend the summit at the joint invitation of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Hua said."},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd310e2a31024ad0ba9b50a.html","title":"US administration accused of politically meddling with response to COVID-19 pandemic","time":"2020-12-11 14:25","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd310e2a31024adbda79a75.jpeg","content":"A member of the news media walks along the West Wing Driveway while wearing a protective face mask at the White House in Washington, US, Dec 10, 2020.

[Photo/Agencies] \n  \n \nAmericans are getting greater access to coronavirus test kits that aim to detect the virus easily and quickly from the comfort of one's home. \nThere are two types of at-home tests on the market. One is a saliva test, the other a swab test. \nThe saliva test is an alternative to the uncomfortable nasal swabs now widely used. A user dribbles saliva into a test tube, seals it and sends it to a lab. Doctors examine the secretions to determine if the person has been infected with the virus. \nThe swab test requires a person to swab the inside of their nose or cheek, producing a sample for analysis. \nThe saliva tests are just as effective as ones administered by a doctor, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies also have found saliva tests pose less risk to healthcare workers compared with nasal swabs, the FDA said. \nA report by Yale University called \"Saliva\" said the test is more sensitive than naval swabbing for detecting the virus that causes COVID-19. \n\"When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection,\" the report said. \nIn November, Minnesota became the first state to roll out at-home tests. At least 261,000 kits made by Infinity BiologiX have been distributed, according to The New York Times. \nIn Orange County, California, 500,000 saliva test kits will be given to 3.4 million residents by the end of December. The tests will be sent to people in Anaheim and Santa Ana, two populous California cities with large immigrant communities. \nCounties in New Jersey also are offering the saliva tests. But an effort in Burlington County encountered problems. At least 2,400 kits were sent to residents, but the program was halted after only 900 were mailed back, and the rest were unused. \nBurlington County Health Director Dr Herb Conaway said in a statement: \"The program was designed for homebound residents and those who were unable to travel to our fixed test site or mobile sites. Unfortunately, numerous people have requested the test kits but failed to return them with collected samples for testing, essentially keeping the kits until they decide they need them.\" \nSchools, colleges and sports leagues also are using the saliva tests. The Greenwich Academy, a private prep school for girls in Connecticut, and the Washington University Medical School in St. Louis are among those using the test. \nSeveral companies now sell the at-home saliva test. They include Vault, Vitagene, Hims and Hers and Phosphorus. The tests range in price from $129 to $150. \nAt-home tests that use mouth swabs are sold by Pixel by LabCorp, LetsGet Checked and Everlywell. They are priced from $119 to $150. \nA person who does or doesn't have symptoms can order a test. If it comes from a state-run program, then the kits are paid for by the state offering them, or people can use their health insurance to purchase them. They usually arrive in 24 hours. \nA healthcare worker can supervise how to use the kit properly on a Zoom conference call. Test results are usually ready in one to two days. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has stressed since the start of the pandemic that widespread testing is crucial to stop the spread of the virus. \nIt is hoped that the increased use of at-home tests will help as there is still a fairly long wait to get a coronavirus test from a doctor or pharmacy. Long lines have been seen outside doctors' offices in New York City, Atlanta and other cities. \nMedical testing companies first developed at-home saliva testing kits at the height of the pandemic in March. \nIn May, the first diagnostic saliva test kit to get FDA approval was developed by RUCDR Infinite Biologics, a unit of Rutgers' Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, and Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostic Labs for use at Rutgers University. It can be bought online for $150."},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd2e17da31024ad0ba9b46e.html","title":"Incoming US climate envoy views China a partner","time":"2020-12-11 11:03","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd2e970a31024adbda79572.jpeg","content":"Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry speaks after being introduced by President-elect Joe Biden as he introduces key foreign policy and national security nominees and appointments at the Queen Theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, US, on Nov 24, 2020. [Photo/Agencies] \n  \n \nIncoming US climate envoy John Kerry said he expected to work with China on climate change, as he seeks to bring Washington back to the Paris accord club and enhance global action to address the crisis. \n\"They were a partner on climate as we competed with them at other things during the Obama administration,\" Kerry told National Public Radio when asked if he can collaborate with China on climate issues as the two countries compete on other issues. \n\"We've been there, done that. But if we don't work as a primary extraordinary effort on climate, we're all cooked,\" the former secretary of state said in the interview aired Thursday. \nKerry was tapped to act as \"climate czar\" for President-elect Joe Biden, who vowed to immediately re-enter the 2015 Paris Agreement, a deal that Kerry helped negotiate. \nThe 76-year-old former senator seemed ready to be more pragmatic when it comes to address what he believed are the challenges in China's climate realm. \nHe said Chinese banks are still funding coal-fired power production. \n\"So we have to talk to China about that. But we have to do it in a way that doesn't force people into a corner to hunker down and head towards conflict,\" Kerry said. \nIn addition to conducting ultralow emission upgrading of its coal-fired power plants, China has pledged to eliminate outdated and unqualified ones and to approve new coal-fired power projects \"orderly and moderately based on needs\", according to a statement from the National Development and Reform Commission early this year. \nThe United States formally withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change on Nov 4, a day after Election Day, following a three-year process. \nKerry said rejoining the Paris accord is just the first step. \n\"It's simple for the United States to rejoin but it's not so simple for the United States to regain its credibility,\" Kerry said in the NPR interview. \n\"I think we have to approach this challenge with some humility and with a very significant effort by the United States to show that we're serious and we really are back,\" he said. \nClimate change is among a host of global issues experts and diplomats have called the world's top two emitters of greenhouse gas to work together to deal with. \nDavid Dollar, senior fellow at John L. Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution, said that without the US and China, it is not realistic to deal with climate change, the pandemic or the global debt crisis. \n\"In terms of climate change, I think Americans are much more serious about this,\" Dollar said. \"I think you've got a lot of American support now,\" he said, adding that there has been a similar change in China over the last 10 years. \n\"So we should have better cooperation on some specific issues like climate, even though we're going to continue to have disagreements about various issues,\" he told China Daily on Thursday. \nGraham Allison, a Harvard professor, said it was \"good news\" that when the new administration takes office, Biden understands there's not only nuclear MAD — nuclear mutual assured destruction, which would be the outcome if the US and China ended up in a war. \n\"But there's also climate MAD — climate mutual assured destruction, in which if the two greatest greenhouse gas emitters don't find ways to cooperate, we can create a biosphere that nobody can live in,\" Allison, author of Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?, said at a virtual meeting on Dec 3. \nChinese President Xi Jinping, speaking at a United Nations General Assembly session via video in late September, said China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, both ambitious climate goals that will spur the world's transition to green and low-carbon development. \nChinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai said that in the post-pandemic era, China-US cooperation cannot and should not be absent. \nClimate change is among the global challenges China and the United States should coordinate and cooperate to resolve, he said at a virtual US-China Business Council 2020 annual gala Wednesday night. \nThe two countries should also work together to combat COVID-19, promote global economic recovery and growth, and reform and improve the international governance system and architecture to better address the global challenges, the ambassador said. \n\"This is also what the international community expects of us,\" he said. \nThe ambassador also said that the continuing deterioration of US-China relations, already at their lowest point in decades, will cause \"irreparable damage\" to the fundamental interests of both countries. \n\"At a time of deepening globalization and closely intertwined interests between the two countries, a new 'Cold War' and 'decoupling' will lead nowhere,\" he said. \nHe reiterated that cooperation is the only right choice for both countries, and that their shared interests always come first, so much so that no difference justifies any conflict or confrontation."},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd2dcb1a31024ad0ba9b401.html","title":"Stockholm hosts online Nobel Prize award ceremony","time":"2020-12-11 10:42","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd2dcb1a31024adbda78e8b.jpeg","content":"Preparations are underway before the start of the Nobel Prize ceremony in the Golden Hall of the City Hall of Stockholm on December 10, 2020. [Photo/Agencies] \n  \n \nSTOCKHOLM -- For the first time in history, the Nobel Prize award ceremony was streamed online on Thursday from Stockholm's City Hall due to the coronavirus pandemic. \nThis years' laureates are: Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez (physics); Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A.

That's almost 100 times higher than previous hops and skimming the stratosphere. \nThe launch and ascent of Starship SN8 were successful, but as the engines appeared to reignite for landing, the vehicle flipped back to vertical and then slammed into the ground. \nThe Starship rocket destroyed in the accident was a 16-story-tall prototype for the heavy-lift launch vehicle being developed by entrepreneur Elon Musk's private space company to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. \nThe self-guided rocket blew up as it touched down on a landing pad following a controlled descent. The test flight had been intended to reach an altitude up to 12.5 km, propelled by three of SpaceX's newly developed Raptor engines for the first time. But the company left unclear whether the rocket had flown that high. \nThe company said Starship SN8 lifted off from the launchpad in Cameron County, Texas, and successfully ascended, transitioned propellant, and performed its landing flip maneuver with precise flap control to reach its landing point. \nLanding failure \nMusk said in a tweet immediately following the landing mishap that the rocket's \"fuel header tank pressure was low\" during descent, \"causing touchdown velocity to be high\". \nHe added that SpaceX had obtained \"all the data we needed\" from the test and hailed the rocket's ascent phase a success. \nSpaceX made its first attempt to launch Starship on Tuesday, but a problem with its Raptor engines forced an automatic abort just one second before liftoff. \nThe complete Starship rocket, which will stand 120.09 meters tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is the company's next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle－the center of Musk's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine. \nNASA awarded SpaceX $135 million to help develop Starship, alongside competing vehicles from rival ventures Blue Origin, the space company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Leidos-owned Dynetcis. \nThe three companies are vying for future contracts to build the moon landers under NASA's Artemis program, which calls for a series of human lunar explorations within the next decade. \nRight before Wednesday's launch, NASA announced the 18 US astronauts to be trained for the Artemis moon-landing program. \nAgencies - Xinhua"},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd2cc1ca31024ad0ba9b377.html","title":"UK signs Singapore free-trade deal","time":"2020-12-11 09:32","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd2cc1ca31024adbda789f2.jpeg","content":"This handout from Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry taken and released on Dec 10, 2020 shows Britain's International Trade Secretary Liz Truss (L) and her Singaporean counterpart Chan Chun Sing signing a free-trade deal in Singapore.

[Photo by Zhu Xingxin/China Daily] \n  \n \nChina has emerged as an increasingly important player in the fourth industrial revolution, having patented technologies at a rate that is growing at double the global average, according to a European Patent Office study released on Thursday. \nFrom a very low starting point in the late 2000s, China's innovative activity has increased very quickly, registering an annual average growth between 2010 and 2018 of 39.3 percent, which is twice the global average of 19.7 percent. \nChina overtook South Korea in 2017 and, after generating more than 6,300 international patent families in 2018, now stands almost on par with Europe and Japan. \nAntonio Campinos, president of the European Patent Office, said: \"Our study shows that Chinese innovation in the field of fourth industrial revolution technologies has increased greatly. China has displayed, by far, the fastest growth of all major innovation centers around the world. Its universities, businesses, and regional hubs are becoming increasingly important players in the global 4IR innovation landscape.\" \nThe study further reveals that China's innovation in the field of the fourth industrial revolution is specialized in connectivity and software, areas in which companies such as its technology giants Huawei and ZTE have become world leaders. \nThe report shows Huawei, which was outside the top 10 between 2000 and 2009, moved up to fifth place between 2010 and 2018. \nZTE is the second Chinese company to be listed in the 20 leading companies in the field, ranked 13th. \nIn addition, both Shenzhen and Beijing are among the world's most important clusters for fourth industrial revolution patents, with Shenzhen accounting for 3.1 percent of all global patents in the field, ranking it fifth, and Beijing accounting for 2.3 percent between 2010 and 2018. \nWith a growth rate of more than 30 percent annually since 2010, Beijing is now the fastest-growing innovation cluster in the top 20. \nThe study, entitled Patents and the Fourth Industrial Revolution - the global technology trends enabling the data-driven economy, looks at all international patent families from 2000 to 2018, and shows that innovation in fourth industrial revolution technologies has accelerated significantly worldwide. \nGlobal patent filings for the technologies, which involve smart, connected objects and span the internet of things, big data, 5G, and artificial intelligence, grew at an average annual rate of almost 20 percent - nearly five times faster than the average for all technology fields, between 2010 and 2018. \n\"Constellations of smart, connected devices, faster wireless internet, big data, and AI are transforming the global economy and having a profound impact across many sectors, from manufacturing to healthcare to transport,\" Campinos said. \"What we are seeing is not just an acceleration of the development of information and communications technology - it is a major shift toward a fully data-driven economy.\""},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5fd2c88ea31024ad0ba9b320.html","title":"Tunisian president inaugurates new hospital built with Chinese aid","time":"2020-12-11 09:17","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd2c88ea31024adbda783a1.jpeg","content":"Tunisian President Kais Saied (center), China's Ambassador to Tunisia Zhang Jianguo (3rd right), and Tunisian Minister of Health Faouzi Mehdi (4th R) pose for a group photo at the inauguration ceremony of a new university hospital in Sfax Province, southeastern Tunisia, on Dec 10, 2020.

[Photo/Xinhua] \n  \n \nFRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank (ECB) said on Thursday that it decided to expand the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) by another 500 billion euros (605 billion U.S. dollars) and extend the duration of the program to at least the end of March 2022, as part of a fresh stimulus package to bolster the economy. \nThe newly announced measures were taken \"in view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic,\" the ECB said in a statement after a monetary policy meeting. \nThe PEPP was first launched in March this year and was expanded by 600 billion euros in June. The program now stands at a total of 1.85 trillion euros. \nThe ECB also strengthened support for bank lending, namely the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). It will extend the temporary favorable terms for the program to June 2022, and add three additional operations between June and December 2021. \nFour additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) will be offered in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop, the ECB also said. \nEurozone key interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels, with the base interest rate, marginal lending rate and deposit rate unchanged at 0.00 percent, 0.25 percent and minus 0.50 percent, respectively. \nThe ECB also extended the duration of many temporary favorable conditions announced earlier this year. It extended reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023, and also extended the duration of the set of collateral easing measures announced in April this year to June 2022. \nThe regular asset purchase program (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of 20 billion euros, it added. \nREVISED OUTLOOK \nDespite the stronger-than-expected rebound of economic activity in the third quarter and encouraging prospects for vaccine roll-out, the pandemic \"continues to pose serious risks to public health and to the euro area and global economies,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde said at the press conference. \nIncoming data and ECB staff projections suggest \"a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged,\" Lagarde said. \nThe baseline scenario of the December ECB staff projections foresees euro area annual real GDP growth at minus 7.3 percent in 2020, 3.9 percent in 2021, 4.2 percent in 2022 and 2.1 percent in 2023. Compared with the projections in September, the outlook was revised down in the short-term, before largely recovering to previously projected levels in the medium term. \nHeadline inflation for the currency bloc, which has stayed below zero since August, is likely to remain negative until early 2021, according to Lagarde. The ECB staff foresees annual inflation at 0.2 percent in 2020, 1.0 percent in 2021, 1.1 percent in 2022 and 1.4 percent in 2023. \nUNCERTAINTY REMAINS \nThe ECB stimulus came as the continent is dealing with a new wave of COVID-19 infections, with many countries re-imposing containment measures in the run-up to holiday season. \nLagarde said Thursday that \"uncertainty remains high,\" including the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs. \nCiting estimates from scientists and health experts, Lagarde said that sufficient herd immunity is likely to be reached by the end of 2021, when the economy, especially the service sector, could be functioning under more normal circumstances. \nShe noted that one of the key goals for the policy measure package is to preserve favorable financing conditions, adding that the ECB will have the flexibility to tailor purchases under its bond-buying programs according to market conditions. \nLagarde also reiterated that the ECB will monitor the value of the euro \"very carefully.\" Although the ECB does not target exchange rate, the appreciation of the euro is likely to put downward pressure on prices, she said. \nRegarding fiscal policies, Lagarde said the Governing Council recognizes the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. \nThursday's measures were largely in line with market expectations, as ECB's policymakers have previously signaled that an updated pandemic response would come in December. \nThe ECB is giving itself a lot of flexibility with the design of its measures, especially with regard to keep interest rates low in the countries hardest hit by the pandemic and to prevent further divergence in the euro area, Marcel Fratzscher, president of Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research, wrote in a comment. \nFriedrich Heinemann, an economist from the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, said the big task facing the Governing Council next year is how to communicate the exit from the bond purchases carefully and still credibly.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said it didn't provide enough funding for unemployment insurance. \nPelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have recently said that they want to attach the long-awaited COVID-19 relief legislation to an omnibus funding bill. \nThe House on Wednesday passed a one-week stopgap funding bill to keep the federal government open through Dec. 18, providing more time for lawmakers to negotiate a deal in COVID-19 relief and long-term government funding. \nIn a letter to Congress earlier this week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that failure to enact a meaningful pandemic package \"risks a double-dip recession that will permanently shutter small businesses across the nation and leave millions of Americans with no means to support themselves and their families.\" \nAs of Monday, 17 percent of restaurants, or more than 110,000 establishments, were closed permanently or long-term amid the COVID-19 crisis, according to the National Restaurant Association. \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday reported a seven-day moving average of 202,021 new COVID-19 cases, the first time it has surpassed 200,000 since the outbreak. Total cases in the United States have topped 15 million. \n\"While vaccines offer a light at the end of the tunnel, the labor market will remain under pressure in the short run,\" Quinlan said."},{"href":"//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202012/11/WS5f84e333a31024ad0ba7e357.html","title":"US COVID-19 deaths top 290,000","time":"2020-12-11 08:20","imgSrc":"//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202012/11/5fd2dda5a31024adbda78f52.jpeg","content":"We provide the latest updates and crucial information on the global COVID-19 pandemic here \nDec 11 \nOutside China \n \n  \n \n   The latest figures reported by each government's health authority as of Dec 11, 2020. \n  \n \n- US COVID-19 deaths top 290,000: Johns Hopkins University (Read more) \n- Most Americans not committed to taking COVID-19 vaccine (Read more) \n- Australian COVID-19 vaccine program scrapped (Read more) \n- US Texas county to add temporary coolers to hold bodies as COVID-19 deaths rise (Read more) \n- UK rolls out mass testing in secondary schools as COVID-19 cases rise \n- France extends closure of culture venues, imposes stricter curfew \nChina \n \n  \n \n   Latest data released by National Health Commission by midnight, Dec 10, 2020. \n  \n \n- Chinese mainland reports 15 new COVID-19 cases, 6 locally transmitted, 9 imported (Read more) \nDec 10 \nOutside China \n- US daily death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000: Johns Hopkins University \n- UN chief says he will take COVID-19 vaccine (Read more) \n- People with serious allergies warned against receiving COVID-19 vaccine in Britain (Read more) \n- France's reopening plan in doubt as another 14,595 COVID-19 cases tallied (Read more) \n- Ukraine to introduce lockdown Jan 8-24 \n- COVID-19 infections exceed 300,000 in Sweden \nChina \n- Chinese mainland reports 12 new COVID-19 cases, 1 locally transmitted, 11 imported (Read more) \nDec 9 \nOutside China \n- US COVID-19 cases surpass 15 mln, remains the nation worst hit by the pandemic, with the world's most cases and deaths, making up more than 22 percent of the global caseload (Read more) \n- A 90-year-old woman from Northern Ireland became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine out of a trial as UK's mass vaccination program began on Tuesday (Read more) \n- Cruise ship returns to Singapore after passenger tests positive for COVID-19 (Read more) \n- Israel to begin mass COVID-19 vaccinations on Dec 20: health ministry (Read more) \nChina \n- Chinese mainland reports 15 new COVID-19 cases, 4 locally transmitted, 11 imported (Read more) \nDec 8 \nOutside China \n- A robust and very strong safety monitoring system is in place for vaccines globally to ensure their safety: WHO (Read more) \n- Canada could start vaccine plan in mid-December: PM (Read more) \n- Africa's confirmed COVID-19 cases pass 2.26 mln: Africa CDC \n- Chile's capital reimposes weekend lockdowns as COVID-19 cases rise (Read more) \nChina \n- Chinese mainland reports 12 new COVID-19 cases, 2 locally transmitted, 10 imported (Read more) \n- Three new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Chengdu, Sichuan province (Read more) \nDec 7 \nOutside China \n- Global COVID-19 cases top 67 mln: Johns Hopkins University \n- Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani tests positive for COVID-19 (Read more) \n- COVID-19 death toll in US border county tops 1,000 (Read more) \n- Vast region of US state of California to enter into new stay-at-home order amid COVID-19 surge \n- Russia reports single-day record of 29,039 new COVID-19 cases \nChina \n- Chinese mainland reports 15 new COVID-19 cases, 3 locally transmitted, 12 imported (Read more) \nDec 6 \nOutside China \n- US sets record of 227,885 COVID-19 cases in one day (Read more) \n- US COVID-19 deaths top 280,000: Johns Hopkins University \nChina \n- Chinese mainland reports 18 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 17 imported, 1 locally transmitted \nDec 5 \nOutside China \n- Iran's COVID-19 death toll surpasses 50,000 (Read more) \n- Russia confirms single-day record of 28,782 new COVID-19 cases \n- US sets record of 225,201 COVID-19 cases in one day (Read more) \n- US governors press federal gov't, Congress to pass COVID-19 relief bill (Read more) \n- Fauci accepts Biden's offer to be his chief medical adviser (Read more) \nChina \n- Hong Kong reports 101 new confirmed COVID-19 cases (Read more) \n- Chinese mainland reports 17 new COVID-19 cases, with 2 locally transmitted \nDec 4 \nOutside China \n- US COVID-19 cases surpass 14 mln -
